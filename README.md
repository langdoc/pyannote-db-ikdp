# pyannote.database plugin for [IKDP](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP) data

This is based on Herv√© Bredin's [template](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-db-template) for [pyannotate](https://github.com/pyannote) plugins. It is experimental and doesn't currently work or contain usable data, but will be updated as testing goes forward.
